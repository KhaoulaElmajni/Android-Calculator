# <strong style="color:#fd0f0f; opacity: 0.80">Scientific CALCULATOR</strong> :mortar_board: :computer:
## <span style="color:blue "> 1.Project Presentation</span>:pushpin: 
* <strong style="color:dark">This project is a Scientific Calculator,that any body can use it for counting a standard operations.
* <strong style="color:dark">this is an
application that allows us to practice the event management with a graphical interface a bit complex. It is therefore proposed to you to carry out a calculator, with a simple graphical interface.

* <strong style="color:dark">The general organization requested in this project is : 
1.     LinearLayout
1.     2 TextViews at the top of the screen 
        input
        output
1.     TableLayout
        23 Buttons at the bottom
    
By using the LinearLayout with a vertical orientation, we
placed 2 TextViews at the top of the screen on fullwidth with right-aligned text as well as a TableLayout at the bottom.
    
# <span style="color:green">2.Technologies Used</span>:pushpin:
 #### <span style="color:#0036ad"> 1.JAVA Language::white_check_mark:</span>
 * <strong style="color:dark">Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. 

*see also* [JAVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
#### <span style="color:#0036ad"> 2.Android:</span>
 * <strong style="color:dark">Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
    
#### <span style="color:#0036ad"> 3.Rhino: JavaScript in Java:</span>
 * <strong style="color:dark">Rhino is a JavaScript engine written fully in Java and managed by the Mozilla Foundation as open source software. It is separate from the SpiderMonkey engine, which is also developed by Mozilla, but written in C++ and used in Mozilla Firefox.

 <strong style="color:red">How does a Rhino engine work?  </strong> :white_check_mark:  
Rhino converts JavaScript scripts into classes. Rhino works in both compiled and interpreted mode. It is intended to be used in desktop or server-side applications, hence there is no built-in support for the Web browser objects that are commonly associated with JavaScript.
    i implemented it with gradle :

## <strong style="color:blue">Conculsion :100:  </strong>
* <strong style="color: dark ; opacity: 0.80">This work allowed us to know how Android Studio works, and how XML and Java files communicate, how we can add components, and of course the way we want to customize our components in our application.

    * <strong style="color: dark ; opacity: 0.80">Finally I want say thank you to the one and only, My professor Mrs BOUIHI Bouchra *Doctor Assistant in UH2* for his supporting  and encouraging to us, also for giving us this opportunity to improve our skills in mobile development.
